It went smoothly, and the technical portion was not as difficult as I'd previously experienced. They wanted to see what I knew, caring less about finding the solution and more about seeing how I solved problems. It was overall a great experience and I'm grateful for it.

I accepted for a variety of reasons. The interview process was smooth, and the teams I interacted with were kind, fun, and positive.
